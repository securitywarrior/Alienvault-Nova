The Alienvault-Nova project provides integration between the Nova Project honeypot (http://novaproject.org) and Alienvault OSSIM (http://www.alienvault.com). 

To avoid unnecessary complexity I've leveraged the ADHD project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/adhd/) to do the heavy lifting in the initial Nova setup. 
Many thanks to John Strand, Ethan Robish and Kevin Johnson for putting this together. 

Extra kudos to John Strand and Paul Asadoorian for their Offensive Countermeasures: The Art of Active Defence book as well. If you are looking at this project I highly suggest picking up this book. 

This project provides automation in starting the Nova daemons as well as all of the necessary integration for sending logs to Alienvault for processing. 

See the readmes in the 'Nova' and 'Alienvault' folders for specifics in how to set up integration. You'll also want to check out the documentation in ADHD in customizing your haystack configuration.
